# dynamic library loading

Small test script in c to test the dynamic loading and exchange of shared
libraries on  runtime. It uses ```dlfcn.h``` to open the library and find the
correct function address. Could be interesting for hot code reloading/swapping
during runtime, similar to Erlang, or for a plugin system, which does not
require a restart of the host program.

Makefile is written for MacOS, but should be easily rewritten for Linux.
